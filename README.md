# Predict Future Sales Using Facebook´s Novel Prophet Package

## Goal of this project
The intention of this project is to test the feasibility of applying the novel but already well known facebook package "fbprophet" to forecast future markets sales based on historical data. We will attack this challenge by explicitely using temporal information (i.e. not just simple regression).

## Intuition behind Facebook´s prophet approach
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.

The strengths of facebook´s prophet are accurate and fast resuls, minimal need for data preprocessing e.g. handels missing data and outliers and simple integration of domain knowledge into the forcast.
